# about me
I'm self-taught with programming.  Been interested in it for years and have dabbled at times various intense periods working through book or online tutorials.  In recent years I managed to accomplish some work publishing two apps in the iOS world though no longer keeping my license up with Apple.  I'm also a musician and have been drawn to work with programming in relation to the music.  I was fascinated by Apple's AudioUnits and worked through Chris Adamson's book on writing them.  In the last year I've spent a lot of time once again with Miller Puckett's open-source programming environment Pure Data that I first got into in 2016 and come/go as the interests and projects beg.  Also in the last year I have begun educating myself in Python largely out of interest in the OpenAPS community.  So bottomline I'm still a green learner but have some ability.  I've been signed up on Git for a while but have not made an attempt to learn to use it properly and am doing that just now.
